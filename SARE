#The Stepwise Approach to Rabies Elimination
## A Planning and Evaluation Tool


###Acknowledments
This tool was made available upon request of countries endemic for dog-transmitted rabies. During the process of elaboration, the concept and tool has continuously been subject to review by and input from national or regional rabies meetings, mainly held in rabies endemic regions of Africa and Asia. The numerous contributors over time are acknowledged for their precious input, and FAO, GARC and WHO for their continuous institutional support and expertise provided. We wish to extend our sincere gratitude to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the UBS Optimus Foundation for their generous financial support.

###Introduction
**1) Why a tool for a stepwise rabies control?**
Rabies is classified as a Neglected Zoonotic Disease by WHO. As a result of chronic underreporting and political neglect the true burden of the disease remains unknown. The transmission of rabies occurs most commonly through wounds or direct exposure of mucosal surfaces to bites and scratches from rabid animals. Dogs are the main source of human exposure to rabies and human rabies deaths. Dog-transmitted rabies is estimated to kill tens of thousands of people per year and to cause significant losses in production animals. Over 95% of all human rabies deaths occur in Asia and Africa. In these regions, the disease is inextricably linked to poverty and is having a negative impact on the ability of countries to meet the Millennium Development Goals, particularly the goal to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger (MDG 1) and reduce child mortality (MDG 4), by 2015. Human rabies of dog origin is a close to 100% vaccine-preventable zoonosis. Vaccination of dogs is the most effective way to achieve a significant and lasting reduction in the number of rabies-related human deaths. The prevention of human rabies is dependent upon the effective and verifiable control of dog-transmitted rabies. In light of these facts, FAO, GARC and partners have decided to create a tool which focuses on the prevention of dog-transmitted human rabies.

Many steps towards international control and elimination of dog-transmitted rabies have already been taken. At the global level, FAO, OIE and WHO declared rabies a priority disease (1). Besides national strategies developed by individual countries, several regional strategies for the elimination of dog-transmitted rabies already exist or are under development (2, 3). Increasing resources, technical guidance or standards on dog- transmitted rabies prevention and control for the successful and sustainable implementation of rabies programmes are available (4, 5, 6). Over the past years international organizations such as FAO, OIE and WHO have initiated global capacity programmes to strengthen national public health systems (7) and veterinary services (8, 9). However, the implementation of rabies prevention and control programmes is in the hands of national authorities that have to cope with a multiplicity of human and animal disease priorities while attempting to overcome the challenges associated with planning across sectors and administrative levels. The table below summarizes main challenges and opportunities for rabies control as identified by countries and various 

| Challenges | Opportunities |
| --- | --- |
| While most of the control costs incur in the animal health sector, benefits are mainly regarding public health.  |   Elimination of human dog- transmitted rabies is feasible – best at the animal source
|Rabies falls between cracks - no responsibility and coordination between sectors   |   100% fatal infectious disease - 100% vaccine preventable
|Weak or non-existent political will - while identified as a priority zoonotic disease   |   ‘One Health approach’ provides basis for intersectoral collaboration
|Vicious circle of neglect - lack of data and information leads to lack of committed will and resources   |   Rabies elimination is a global public good
|Low value of dogs in societies - low priority by veterinary professionals, despite rabies-related livestock losses   |   Regional rabies platforms and roadmaps available
|   | Availability of communication,education material & World Rabies Day as a powerful advocacy tool


**2) Concept behind the tool for dog-transmitted rabies prevention, control and eventually elimination: “The Stepwise Approach towards Rabies Elimination” (SARE)**

The Stepwise Approach towards Rabies Elimination (SARE) has been developed as a template that countries may use to develop activities and measure progress towards a national programme and strategy for sustainable rabies prevention, control and eventually elimination. This tool focuses on the prevention of dog- transmitted human rabies, which is hereafter is simply referred to as “rabies”.

For easy reference activities are linked to the “Canine Rabies Blueprint” a readily accessible, open source tool containing regularly updated information on rabies interventions from a large variety of sources. This tool follows the principles of enhancing intersectoral collaboration with the goal of sustained rabies risk reduction over time (10, 11). There are 3 activities which are considered crucial from the beginning and across all stages:

*Dog Vaccination <enter>
*Rabies awareness / communication <enter>
*Making PEP available and accessible <enter>

SARE is not prescriptive nor is it intended to replace existing regional or national rabies control strategies. This tool may serve as self-assessment and a practical guide in developing a national rabies programme and to successfully implement the different described stages. The tool will be continuously improved over time through the sharing of experiences by participating regions and countries, and as relevant documentation of these efforts become available.

**Key elements of effective intersect oral collaboration**
The table below shows the outcome of a high level meeting (11) and reflects the internationally agreed overarching principles for successful implementation of intersectoral collaboration in the spirit of a “One Health” approach. These principles are applicable but not limited to rabies.
